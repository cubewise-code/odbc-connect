**ODBC Connect** is a Windows user interface for **ODBC data sources**. It enables you to query both 32bit and 64bit ODBC data sources and also extract data using a command line interface. It was primarily designed and built to make life easier for developers of IBM Cognos TM1 but can be used by anyone wanting to have a graphical tool to query ODBC data sources.

The features include:

* Graphical User Interface (GUI) to 32bit and 64bit data sources
* Lists the tables and columns schema in the data source
* Generation of SQL statements by dragging tables to the SQL editor
* Multiple tabbed interface
* Query results in a grid or exported to file
* Detailed error messages to solve query errors
* Command line options to extract data to file
* Generation of TM1 Turbo Integrator (TI) ExecuteCommand commands for using 32bit ODBC drivers in 64bit TM1
* Due to the wide availability of ODBC drivers it can be used with most relational database management systems (RDBMS), for example: SQL Server, Oracle, MySql, Postgresql, DB2, Sqlite, etc.
